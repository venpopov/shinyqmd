This option is not via shiny, but via the `plotly` R package. It does not perform online computations. I have to precompute the data for all sliders. I also cannot show new randomly generated data on the fly.

The easiest option is to create the plot in ggplot and specify the `frame` aesthetic. This will create a slider that allows you to move through the frames.

TODO: Can I add more than one slider?

Let's create a visualization of the central limit theorem. We will generate 1000 random samples of size `n` from a uniform distribution and plot the mean of each sample. As `n` increases, the distribution of the sample means will approach a normal distribution.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

n <- 1:1000
means <- sapply(n, function(n) mean(runif(n)))

df <- data.frame(n = n, means = means)


p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = means)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
  labs(
    title = "Central Limit Theorem",
    x = "Mean",
    y = "Frequency"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()




p <- ggplotly(p, dynamicTicks = TRUE)

p
```

title: "Shiny app in Quarto tests"
---

This repo tests several ways to embed a Shiny app in a Quarto document.

## Local use via github link

This works:

```r
shiny::runGitHub("shinyqmd", "venpopov", subdir = "app1")
```

## A separate shiny dashboard run locally

run this in the terminal:

```bash
quarto serve attempt3.qmd
```

it works locally, but it's not part of the project (had to exclude it from the `_quarto.yml` file)
